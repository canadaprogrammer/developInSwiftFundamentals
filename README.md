# Develop in Swift Fundamentals

## Unit 1 Getting Started With App Development

### Lesson 1.1 Start Defining Your App

- Guide
  - App Design Workbook
    - Begin by opening the App Design Workbook and familiarizing yourself with the layout.
    - Read the Welcome pages to learn about how to use the workbook, Keynote, and the other resources you will need.
    - You’ll use the workbook to document your app design process and ideas throughout the course, so save it in an easy-to-find place on your device.
    - Also, remember that this course focuses on UIKit, so the SwiftUI coding exercises in the App Design Workbook are optional.
    - Use the App Design Workbook to complete the following exercises.
  - Discover
    - Think about your favorite app.
    - What’s its purpose? What problem(s) does it solve?
    - Assuming you’re thinking about a well-designed app, it’s probably fairly easy to answer these questions.
    - Many great apps focus on one particular type of user and one or two issues — and therefore have a very specific set of goals.
    - Use the Discover section of the App Design Workbook to begin identifying a challenge and the people it affects.
    - By the end of this part of the workbook, you’ll have a thorough understanding of a challenge and an insight into the people who would benefit from a solution.
  - Analyze
    - Now it’s time to dig a little deeper.
    - The more you understand the issue and audience, the more targeted the app will be — and the more likely it is that it will solve a problem that a group of users experiences.
    - Complete the Analyze section of the App Design Workbook. By the end of this stage, you’ll have a clearer picture of the form your app might take.
    - You’ll look at the root causes of your users’ challenges, and you’ll use them to drive feature ideas that take advantage of key iOS capabilities while contrasting your ideas with existing apps.
  - Coming Up
    - As you build your coding knowledge in the rest of this unit, you’ll regularly return to your app idea and think about how you might use what you are learning to make the app you care about come to life. Keep your App Design Workbook handy so that you can refer back to it and add notes to keep your app design ideas and plans moving forward.
